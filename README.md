# About Fantasy Fumble

Welcome to _Fantasy Fumble_, an evolving NFL fantasy game designed for fun, strategy, and community. This project starts as a simple game-week points manual calculator, but it’s just the first step in a much larger vision. Over time, Fantasy Fumble will grow into a full-fledged fantasy league platform, packed with features to keep you and your friends engaged all season long.

This project isn’t just about the game—it’s also a showcase of my skills in Ruby on Rails and a passion project built to refine and demonstrate my expertise in web development.

Whether you're here to join the fantasy fun or explore the code behind it, I hope Fantasy Fumble sparks your interest and inspires collaboration.

Features (Current and Planned):

- Manual Game Week Points Calculator: Track and calculate scores easily.
- Save Your Teams: Manage your teams and get automatic game-week points calculations. (Planned)
- Fantasy MVP Mode: Save your team, compete in a standard league, and battle it out with other logged-in users for bragging rights. (Planned)
- League Management Tools: Build, join, and manage leagues. (Planned)
- Draft and Trade Features: Keep your teams competitive. (Planned)
- Dynamic Player Statistics: Real-time data integration. (Planned)

This project is open-source and actively developed. Feel free to check out the repository, suggest improvements, or contribute!
